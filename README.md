### World_Weather_Analysis Module_6

##__Overview of Project__

   The purpose of this analysis was to render weather data from weather sources that provide API keys for parsing. Clean and organize the data
so that our gmaps modules can read what we are trying to visualize on a proper scaled map. Users are going to be using this program to enter
in their preferred vacation weather and be shown an large amount of hotels across the world that fit the criteria for where they would
like to vacation. They will be able to enter their ideal temperature, view multiple locations and plan out an itinerary traveling 
between their destinations.

Here is the view the user will have of the hotel locations parsed after entering in their preferred temperature range. From here they will be
able to click on each individual icon on the map and view the hotels name, location and current weather and description of the weather at the
exact time they started the search.
